    <h2>The story</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <div>
          <p class="firstp">I have vague childhood memories watching Formula One on TV with my father,
          but I didn't start following the sport until I was in my 30s. By then my
          father's dementia was already quite severe. </p>
          <p>I&nbsp;told him about going to Monza,
          Spa and Barcelona, and he would briefly mention Ronnie Peterson and Fittipaldi.
          Like any Swede of his generation would have done, I guess.</p>
          <p>But in early 2017, I unexpectedly recognized some very familiar faces going
          through old family photo albums. Amazing close-ups of both legendary Formula One
          cars and their drivers!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <p>Turns out my father had been quite the Formula One fan, and that he had been to the
          very first Swedish Grand Prix in Anderstorp 1973.</p>
          <p>On June 16, the day before the race, regular visitors like him were
          apparently allowed to walk around freely in the paddock.
          The contrast with today's secrecy and off-limits areas is absolutely mind-blowing!</p>
          <p>The photos were shot with a simple compact camera, an Agfa Silette 135.
          I had the slides scanned professionally, then removed dust and speckles but
          decided to keep all other editing, even the cropping, to an absolute minumum.</p>
